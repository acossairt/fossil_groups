forest_table = pd.read_hdf('/data/a/cpac/aurora/reducedtrees0.h5', 'ft')
z0_table = forest_table.mass.loc[forest_table.snap_num == 99] # only use z = 0
z0_masses_norm = z0_table.array # These are still normalized by a factor of 2.7e9
z0_masses = z0_masses_norm * 2.7e9 # Unscale them -- masses now have noremal units!

#Take a look at the statistics
z0_masses.min()
z0_masses.max()
z0_masses.mean()

#Draw a histogram
plt.hist(z0_masses, bins = 'auto',  log = True)

# Notes
# You might need to set range to something other than min and max;
# there are some non-negligible outliers out there. Use masses.mean()
# to guide that decision.
# You can also set a range for the y-axis using plt.ylim((lower_lim, upper_lim)
